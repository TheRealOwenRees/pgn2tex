## 0.2.0
- Added support for customer headers `title` and `subtitle, allowing the overriding of standard PGN headers in the PDF.

## v0.1.7
- Fixed bug where no date in the PGN header was being rendered as `undefined`

## v0.1.6
- Variation comments are now displayed.
- Additional TeX sanitisation: removing double spaces, adding a space after a move number if preceded by parenthesis.
