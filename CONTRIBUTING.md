# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the repository's issues.

If you are wanting to tackle one of the pre-existing issues, please comment on that issue so that you can be assigned to it.

Alternatively, just send a PR and I will check it asap. Please bear in mind that I may not be reactive if I was not expecting a PR.

## Guidelines
- We use the [GitHub Flow](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-branch-strategy#github-flow-considerations) branching strategy. Add your code into a feature branch such as `feature/feature-name`. 
- Write good commit messages. 'Fix bug' is not a good commit message. 'Fix bug with comments before moves' is a good commit message.
- Explain the changes in the PR comments
