# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the repository's issues.

If you are wanting to tackle one of the pre-existing issues, please comment on that issue so that you can be assigned to it.

Alternatively, just send a PR and I will check it asap. Please bear in mind that I may not be reactive if I was not expecting a PR.

## Guidelines
- Commit and push your work on a new branch that is self-explanatory. `feature/comments-before-moves` would be a good example
- Write good commit messages. These are for my benefit, as the PR will be rebased onto the main branch anyway
- Explain the changes in the PR comments
